#Kata Chop

I did [this kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html).

To run everything you'll need the python nosetest framework which you can get
with one of `easy_install nose` or `pip install nose`. Run the tests by changing
to the toplevel of the project and running `nosetests` in your shell.

You can get performance numbers on the various implementations by running
chopper.py with `python chopper.py`
